Exercises Part 4
set 7
1. the act method, get actors method, processactors, getmovelocations, selectmovelocations,make move.
2. getActors(); processActors getMoveLocations(); selectMoveLocation makeMove(loc);
3. no because all critters need to know if there are other actors on the grid
4. 
    1. it checks to see what each actor is an       puts them into arrays based on what type        they are.
    2. it could put them all into one array
    3. it could just save the coordinates of       the acotr.
5. getMoveLocations: it gets all the locations that it can move to. selectMoveLocation: It selects where to move to. makemove: it mves the critter.
6. because all the methods have parameters that change.
